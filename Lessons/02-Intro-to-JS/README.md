## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students will be able to...

1. Use basic JavaScript constructs such as functions, conditionals, loops, and objects.
1. Read, understand, and use arrow functions to write shorter, more concise code.
1. Create and resolve Promises in order to execute code asynchronously.

## Warm-Up: Observations

List 3 things that are different in JavaScript than what you are used to in Python. Submit your list in the Zoom chat.

## TT: JavaScript fundamentals [30 minutes]

### Semicolons

JavaScript has **optional semicolons** which can be used after statement of code. You will see them used in tutorials and assignments (they used to be required in old versions of JS), but you do not need to use them yourself.

### Variables: const, let, var

Use `const` if you are declaring a variable which will not be reassigned:

```js
const myVar = 'hello';
myVar = 4;
TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

We can, however, still _modify_ the value of an object or list contained in a const variable; we just can't assign it to a _new_ object or list.

```js
const myList = [1, 2, 3, 4];
myList.push(5); // contains [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

Use `let` if you are declaring a variable which will be reassigned:

```js
let myVar = 'hello';
myVar = 5;
```

In general, do not use `var` to assign variables. _Read [here](https://hackernoon.com/why-you-shouldnt-use-var-anymore-f109a58b9b70) for an example of a bug caused by using var (and easily avoided with let)._

### Scoping

`const` and `let` both have "block" scoping - that is, a variable assigned in a block is not available to be used outside of the block. This is generally a good thing because it lets us encapsulate our variable declarations, but it does lead to some interesting errors.

```js
if (4 === 4) {
    let result = "four equals four";
}
console.log(result);
```

Result: <spoiler> `ReferenceError: result is not defined` </spoiler>

### Conditionals

A **conditional** in JavaScript looks like:

```js
if (condition) {
    // do something
}
```

where the _condition_ evaluates to a boolean (true or false).

Note: When comparing for equality, always use the `===` operator, not `==`. This is because `===` uses **strict** equality, which is always what we want.

### For Loops

A typical for loop will use a **counter** variable to run a specific number of times.

```js
const myList = [ ... ]
for (let i = 0; i < myList.length; i += 1) {
    console.log(myList[i])
}
```

Follow-up questions: How do you...

- Traverse the list backwards?
- Traverse every other element?

### Functions

To write a function, use the `function` keyword:

```js
function sayHello(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`)
}
```

### Objects

Think of JavaScript objects (aka JSON) as collections of key-value pairs, where the values can either be _primitives_ (boolean, number, string), or can be _another_ collection of key-value pairs.

```js
const userInfo = {
    name: 'Ada',
    favoriteColor: 'blue',
    address: {
        street: '851 California St',
        city: 'San Francisco',
        state: 'CA'
    }
}
```

We can access the contents like this:

```js
const name = userInfo.name
```

### Arrow Functions

**Arrow functions** were added to the core JavaScript syntax as part of **ES6**. They work (almost) exactly like regular functions, but are shorter to write.

```js
// SHORTEST VERSION
const doubleNum = num => num * 2;

// MORE VERBOSE VERSION
const tripleNum = (num) => {
    return num * 3;
}

doubleNum(6) // 12
tripleNum(6) // 18
```

The above two examples are exactly the same as if I had written:

```js
const doubleNum = function(num) {
    return num * 2;
}
// OR
function doubleNum(num) {
    return num * 2;
}
```

Arrow functions are just **"syntactic sugar"** for concepts that we already know!


## Activity: Pair Programming (15 minutes)

Choose pairs randomly. With your partner, go to the [BEW 1.3 Repl.It classroom](https://replit.com/team/BEW1p3/Arrow-Functions-Practice) and follow the instructions to complete the assignment.

## Break (10 minutes)

## Intro to Promises

### Why do we care about asynchronous code?

JavaScript is a _single-threaded_ language, meaning it can only do one thing at any given time. Think of it like when you are working in the kitchen and can only do one thing at a time: chopping vegetables, washing dishes, or putting away groceries.

But, sometimes we need to call _other_ libraries' functions, and those take some time to return. Think of those like a dishwasher or a rice cooker. You don't want to sit around waiting for them to finish before going on to another task - you want to take advantage of that wait time to do something else.

But how do we know when that external task is finished? Some languages use _event listeners_, which "listen" for a particular alert to go off (kind of like how you wait for your washing machine to play a song to tell you that it's done). JavaScript, however, uses **Promises** and **callbacks**, which let us _specify what we **will** do when the external task finishes._

### Working with a Promise return value

Calling a regular function is like washing the dishes by hand: the program can't work on anything else until it's done.

```js
function wash_dishes_by_hand() {
    console.log('Washing plates...')
    console.log('Washing bowls...')
    console.log('Washing spoons...')
    return 'Done!'
}

wash_dishes_by_hand(); // prints 'Done!'
```

Using a Promise is like running the dishwasher: the program _can_ work on other things while it runs. _As soon as we make the promise_, our **executor** function starts running.

```js
const washDishesExecutor = (resolve, reject) => {
    // ... washing dishes (this step takes some time) ...
    if (dishes_are_clean) {
        resolve('Success! Dishes are done!')
    } else {
        reject('Error! No soap!')
    }
}
const washDishesPromise = new Promise(washDishesExecutor);
```

But how do we know when it's done? We can _resolve_ a promise to specify what to do when it finishes!

```js
washDishesPromise.then((result) => {
    console.log(result) // prints 'Success! Dishes are done!'
}).catch((err) => {
    console.log(err) // prints 'Error! No soap!'
});
```

Try out these examples on your own and see if you can experiment with using promises!
