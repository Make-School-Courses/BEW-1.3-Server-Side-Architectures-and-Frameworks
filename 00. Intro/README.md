# Web 2 Intro

This class is all about making web site with Node JS. Looking deeper it will be a way for you 
to learn how the web works from client to sever, and develop a stronger understanding of 
JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

## Welcome

Welcome to Web 2. 

Class is a like work. Think of this as a work environment rather than a traditional class. 
In a work environment you work in a team. Team members help each other and the goal is to 
produce the best work possible as a team. 

As team members you are not competition, instead it is our goal to support each other in
in the work we are all doing. 

### Work 

It is your job to schedule time and complete the work assigned to you. You will be working 
on several projects over the course of 6 weeks. 

The first projects will be to get everyone up to speed with HTML/CSS/JS. 

After this you will work on a tutorial project. 

Last you will define a custom project for yourself and complete that. 

## Week 1 

The goal of the first week will be to focus on the assessments. It is important that we all know 
our ability. The assessment gives us an opportunity to measure our skills. The team needs to make 
sure all members have the skills to tackle the projects coming up. 

The first step is to measure out HTML/CSS skills. You will all take the HTML and CSS assessments. 

The next step is to solve all of the assessment questions. For this stage you can use the any 
resources you like, Stackoverflow, Google, etc. You can help each other with one exception. 

**If you ask someone for an answer you have to make sure that you understand the answer.** You 
can't just write it down. This is work remember. In school it only matters to have the answer, 
at work you have to understand the answers. 

## Deadline 

The deadline for answering all of the assessment questions is next Monday. 

## Assessment!

Oh no! another assessment. Take the HTML and CSS assessments. These two short assessments will 
give you an opportunity to guage your ability with HTML and CSS. The documents linked to below 
have instructions you can follow.

Note what was said about ad hoc pairing. 

## Solving the Assessments

The goal is to fill in gaps in your knowledge by solving the assessments. To solve the assessments 
you are **allowed** to use Stackoverflow and any internet resources. Feel free to ask your fellow 
classmates to help you. 

Use ad hoc pairing to solve the questions. Ask the instructor questions if you like but, if
always try and solve the questions on your own first. When you feel blocked reach out to 
another student, and the instructor.
