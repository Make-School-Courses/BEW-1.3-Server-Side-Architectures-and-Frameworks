Use this document as a starter project to solve the problems below. 
    
Concept: make a page that displays a list of products
  To solve the problems below use the *Lodash* library.
  
Lodash is a library of helper functions and utilities for JavaScript. 

The MOCK_DATA.json contains 1000 fake product descriptions. 
Your job is to load this data, sort and filter it in various 
ways. 

The mock data is an array of objects that look like this: 

```json
{
  "id":1,
  "name":"Duobam",
  "description":"Implemented even-keeled info-mediaries",
  "price":"$7.77",
  "category":"Outdoors"
}
```

- Filter and Sort the data with Lodash

You need to sort filter and arrange the data to make it more 
managable.

1) Import json data.
  - Use fetch() to import the file MOCK_DATA.json
  - This should give you an array of Objects. 
 */
  
  // Import MOCK_DATA here:
  
  
  
/*

2) Remove duplicates.
  - Many of the entries have duplicate names. Your goal is to remove 
  all of the duplicates by keeping the first instance of a name and 
  dropping any producst with name that come after. Lodash has a method 
  for this: _.uniqBy()
*/
  
  // remove the duplicates with Lodash: 
  
  
  
  
/*

3) Sort the results on category. 
  - Again Lodash has a method for this: _.sortBy()
*/
  // Sort on category: 
  
  
  
/*
4) You might want to paginate in the future. 
  - To do this break the results into groups of 10
  - Turn your array [...] into [ [...1-10],[...11-20],[...21-30], ... ]
  - Lodash to the rescue: _.chunk()
*/
  
  // Chunk the array:
  
  
/*  
Stretch challenges:

1) Write a test for each of the challenges above.
2) Use reduce to transform your data array into an HTML string.  
3) Make a new array of all categories. Each category should be unique.  
4) Use the category list to show only products in that category.
5) Show a detailed view of a selected product as a modal.
6) Use these products with the shopping cart methods. The cart should. 
  - add items
  - remove items 
  - display the current contents of the cart
  - show the total cost of all items in cart
