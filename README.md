# BEW1.2 - Authentication, Associations, & Advanced Queries

## Course Description

In this course we will get into the real meat and potatoes of web development. We will build directly upon the Resourceful and RESTful patterns we learned last class and multiply them by building a clone of Reddit. As we multiply and associate our resources we will learn how to manage and cope with greater and greater complexity in our code while consistently keeping the user's experience in mind. Finally we will look at two ways to authenticate users and learn how to implement both.

## Tutorials & Projects

* [Reddit.js](https://www.makeschool.com/academy/track/reddit-clone-in-node-js)
* [A Custom Authenticated API Project](Projects/02-Custom-API-Project.md)
  * [Rubric](Projects/Rubrics/02-Custom-API-Project.md)

## Additional Resources

* [jwt.io](https://jwt.io)
  * JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties. JWT.IO allows you to **decode, verify and generate JWT**.
* See the **Additional Resources** section at the bottom of each day's lesson plan for the most up-to-date, helpful resources for that class period!

## Evaluation

To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

* Pass all required tutorials and projects (see associated rubrics)
* Pass the final summative assessment >= 70%
* Actively participate in class and abide by the attendance policy
* Make up all classwork from all absences

## Attendance

 Just like any job, attendance at Make School is required and a key component of your success. Attendance is being onsite from 9:30 to 5:30 each day, attending all scheduled sessions: classes, huddles, etc. and working in the study labs when not in a scheduled session. Working onsite allows you to learn with your peers, have access to support from TAs, instructors and others, and is vital to your learning.

Attendance requirements for scheduled sessions are:

* No more than two no call no shows per term in any scheduled session.
* No more than four excused absences per term in any scheduled session.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in a PIP (Participation Improvement Plan).  Failure to improve after the PIP will result in not being invited back next term.
