## Course Description

In this course, students build on knowledge of RESTful web patterns and dive deep into the Node and Express ecosystems. Students learn how to manage greater scope and complexity in their code while consistently keeping the user's experience in mind through implementing a clone of the popular website, Reddit. The course will also cover the procedures required to authenticate and authorize web application users.

## Prerequisites

1. [WEB 1.1](http://make.sc/web1.1)

## Learning Outcomes

Students by the end of the course will be able to&hellip;

1. Diagram and implement resource associations using a document-based database.
1. Write advanced db queries with a focus on optimum performance and efficiency.
1. Discern between differing levels of persistence and the use cases that best fit each.
1. Implement authentication using JWT tokens and sessions.
1. Invent, create, test, deploy, and deliver a custom, fully secured API.
